## Learning Electron for University Purposes
I'm trying to adapt my desktop app for Electron, actually we (my team and me) already made our web app for our University TCC and we need
to do our desktop app too. We're running out of time and we already know html, css and js. That's I'm trying to learn Electron to make
our desktop app.
